# 5_Day_Weather
## Description
This repository contains the source code for my 5_Day_Weather application! This app allows users to immediately see the current weather and the five-day-forecast for their area. You can also search for other areas and their weather.
## Features
This project utilizes a number of different API's, but the two stars of the show are GeoJS and OpenWeather. JQuery and Bootstrap were also used to speed production. On page load, GeoJS get's the geo data for the user's IP address, and uses that city to find and display the most relevent weather. The search form let's you type in a city name, and upon submit will call the OpenWeather API, and save it and display it as a button in your searched history. 
## Usage/Deployed Link

IMPORTANT: Make sure your local storage for the website is clear before running! This code starts expecting there to be nothing in it, and will show bugs elsewise.
